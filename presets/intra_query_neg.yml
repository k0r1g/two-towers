# - All passages with is_selected=1 are used as positives
# - Non-selected passages (is_selected=0) from the same query are used as negatives
# - Negatives are filtered to avoid those containing answer strings

positive_selector: classic  # Use classic_positives function to select positives

negative_sampler:
  type: intra_query_zero  # Sample negatives from the same query's non-selected passages
